# Super Meet

A video conferencing application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API), and [Socket.io](https://socket.io/). 
This project allows users to create or join meeting rooms for real-time video and audio communication, much like Google Meet.


## Overview

Super Meet is a web-based application that leverages Next.js for server-side rendering and routing, WebRTC for peer-to-peer media streaming, and Socket.io for real-time signaling between clients. It provides a basic but extendable framework for creating a video conferencing tool.
